# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working After Build

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply after the build process, even though the CSS file appears to be generated correctly.

## Problem

The provided code uses Tailwind CSS. After building the project (using Vite, Webpack, or a similar build tool), the generated CSS file is present, but the Tailwind CSS classes are not applied in the browser.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the build process correctly includes and processes your Tailwind CSS configuration and directives. The corrected code includes the necessary adjustments to fix the issue. This is typically solved by ensuring proper configuration of your build tool to correctly process Tailwind's directives.
